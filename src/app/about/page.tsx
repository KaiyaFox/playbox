                    <p className="text-gray-400 text-center">
                        PlayBox uses your Spotify account to show detailed, real-time data about your musical journey.
                        From your current plays to affinity stats and popularity metrics â€” youâ€™ll see your tastes in a whole new light.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-primary">How It Works</h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-400 text-center">
                        Simply log in with your Spotify account. PlayBox tracks what you&#39;re playing â€” without actually playing content itself.
                        <br />
                        This means you can stay logged into PlayBox on any device without interrupting your music.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-400 text-center">
                        Get insights like your artist affinity, recent plays, and song popularity. Plus, you can leave comments on tracks you&#39;re listening to and see comments from other PlayBox users â€” linked directly to their Spotify usernames.
